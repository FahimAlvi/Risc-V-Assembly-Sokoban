# Risc-V-Assembly-Sokoban

Sokoban (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is a puzzle game. The original version is played
on a grid representing a warehouse, where every square is a floor or wall. The character occupies a
floor space, and boxes are scattered across the grid, also on floor spaces. Targets (also called
storage locations) are scattered on the floor. Neither the character nor the boxes can enter a wall,
and the character can push one box at a time. The goal is to push all of the boxes onto the targets.
We will mimic the core game-play. You will use the console to interact with a player by (a) printing the
board on the console using symbols (of your choice) to represent the character, boxes, walls, and
target and (b) accepting the next move to make from the player.
